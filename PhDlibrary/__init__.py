"""
This init.py file serves as the entry point for the Python package.
It initializes the package and defines what gets imported when the package is used.
You can place any necessary initialization code here, such as setting up global variables or importing submodules.
It's also common to define the package's version attribute here, to keep track of the package version.
Remember to include a meaningful docstring at the beginning of the file, describing the purpose of the package and any important details.
Overall, this file plays a crucial role in organizing and structuring your package, making it ready to be imported and used by other Python modules and applications.
